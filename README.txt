This program was a project for my recent clase: Software Engineering
This basic program was to demonstrate our understanding of the Decorator Pattern.
"In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class"
